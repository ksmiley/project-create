# Project CREATE

Web application to support HIV prevention in rural parts of the United States by allowing public-health workers to create posters tailored to local demographics.

## Prerequisites

The browser-based poster maker was built in Flash CS3 and has been tested with CS4. It requires Yahoo's [Astra Flash Components](http://developer.yahoo.com/flash/astra-flash/) to build. It also uses [as3corelib](https://github.com/mikechambers/as3corelib), though that code is included in the repo.

The server software is built with PHP and backed by a FileMaker Pro database. It requires the [FX.php](https://github.com/yodarunamok/fxphp) and [Savant3](http://phpsavant.com/) libraries to be installed. See [web/inc/README]() for more information.
